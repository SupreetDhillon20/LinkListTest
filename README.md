Task 1: Linked List Implementation
Your first task is to implement the LinkedList class. The LinkedList class should have the following properties and methods:
Properties:
•	Count: The number of nodes in the list.
•	Head: The first node in the list.
Methods:
•	AddFirst(string value): Adds a new node with the given value to the beginning of the list.
•	AddLast(string value): Adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list.
•	RemoveFirst(): Removes the first node in the list.
•	RemoveLast(): Removes the last node in the list.
•	GetValue(int index): Retrieves the value of the node at the given index.
 
Task 2: Testing
Your second task is to write unit tests to test the functionality of the LinkedList class. The tests should include:
1.	Adding nodes to the beginning of the list
2.	Adding nodes to the end of the list
3.	Removing the first node in the list
4.	Removing the last node in the list
5.	Retrieving the value of a node at a given index
6.	Determining the size of the list
Create a test project that includes these tests and ensures that the LinkedList class works correctly. Test for edge cases, such as retrieving and removing from an empty linked list.
Use the following list of names to populate the linked list:
•	Joe Blow
•	Joe Schmoe
•	John Smith
•	Jane Doe
•	Bob Bobberson
•	Sam Sammerson
•	Dave Daverson
